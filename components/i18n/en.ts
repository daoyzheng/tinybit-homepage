      Hello! My name is Dao and I love to learn and build software applications. I often spend my
      time taking on small projects to improve my skillsets. Currently, I'm in a role with a start-up company based in Calgary
      with experience as a full-stack and a front-end developer. When away from the screen, I enjoy being active by playing basketball and hiking.
